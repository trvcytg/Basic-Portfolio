                            Hi! My name is Todd Tracy. I'm a 27 year old based in Chicago, Illinois. My background is Math and Math Education as well as Photography, Art, and Design.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was born on the East Coast and spent a couple of my years living overseas on a boat. By the time I was ten, I had visited about 25 countries, and my family found a new home in Ohio where I lived until I was twenty-five. The last couple years were spent just north of Houston, Texas taking in the sun and heat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In my spare time I really enjoy spending time in the gym, climbing, and being out in the sun. I also enjoy spending time with friends, exploring the city, watching Netflix, Photography, and creative endeavors!
